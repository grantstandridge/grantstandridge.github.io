    Heading: Schedule
    List:
    - "<strong>Friday 5/18</strong><br>Nothing scheduled for this day! I'll be sleeping
      in Broken Arrow at the Turners' so Callie and I can ride to the rehearsal at
      The Glass Chapel together"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 10a</strong><br>Rehearsal begins at The Glass Chapel.
      It's a little more than 15 minutes from midtown, in north Broken Arrow"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 11a - 2p</strong><br>Rehearsal Brunch @ 624 Kitchen in
      downtown! Brunch buffet menu can be found <a href='/uploads/menu--buffet.jpg'
      target='_blank'>here</a>. It's going to be <em>good</em>. We've elected to not
      do too many toasts or speeches because it can unintentionally drag on, SO the
      only speeches will be made by the maid-of-honor, best man, Callie & I, and my
      parents. Brunch will likely not last three hours, but we have it reserved that
      long if it does"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 after 2p</strong><br>No plans! Because we're doing brunch
      and the ceremony isn't until Sunday night, we have the rest of Saturday open.
      Callie and I are grabbing dinner around 7 and we'll be out until probably 10
      but other than that, I'm not obligated to anything else"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 10a</strong><br>I'm thinking breakfast – be it donuts,
      bacon & eggs, or whatever – would be fun. I'll probably eat only breakfast until
      the reception later in the evening because there will be <em>so much</em> food
      there"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 noon</strong><br>Let's plan on being at my house by this
      time so we can get ready without having to rush around. &ldquo;Getting ready&rdquo;
      shouldn't take that long but that should give us more than enough time…"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 1:30p</strong><br>We'll leave as a group from my house
      and go to Southern Hills. It would be ideal if Brandon, Jentre, and Asher drove,
      and we all carpooled together because the other dudes will have wives who (I
      think?) will be driving themselves. The reason we're driving to Southern Hills
      is so at the end of the night your cars are there instead of the chapel. Once
      we seven get to the country club around 1:45 - 2, I'll have an Uber Black car
      take us from the club to the chapel"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 2:30p</strong><br>The idea is for all of us to be at the
      chapel no later than this time. We have a room to hang out in until pictures
      @ 4"

Ideally, I'd love for everyone to have their tuxes picked up before the end of Friday the 18<sup>th</sup> (unless Men's Wearhouse has told you otherwise…) They should be paid for at that point, and I will reimburse you for the $20 you probably had to put down for measurements.
