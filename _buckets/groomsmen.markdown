    Heading: Schedule
    List:
    - "<strong>Friday 5/18</strong><br>Nothing scheduled for this day! I'll be sleeping
      in Broken Arrow at the Turners' so Callie and I can ride to the rehearsal at
      The Glass Chapel together"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 10a</strong><br>Rehearsal begins at The Glass Chapel.
      It's a little more than 15 minutes from midtown, in north Broken Arrow"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 11a - 2p</strong><br>Rehearsal Brunch @ 624 Kitchen in
      downtown! Brunch buffet menu can be found <a href='/uploads/menu--buffet.jpg'
      target='_blank'>here</a>. It's going to be <em>good</em>. We've elected not
      to do too many toasts or speeches because it can unintentionally drag on, SO
      the only speeches will be made by the maid-of-honor, best man, Callie & I, and
      my parents. Brunch will likely not last three hours, but we have it reserved
      that long if it does"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 after 2p</strong><br>No plans! Because we're doing brunch
      and the ceremony isn't until Sunday night, we have the rest of Saturday open.
      Callie and I are grabbing dinner around 7 and we'll be out until probably 10
      but other than that, I'm not obligated to anything else"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 10a</strong><br>I'm thinking breakfast – be it donuts,
      bacon & eggs, or whatever – would be fun. I'll probably eat only breakfast until
      the reception later in the evening because there will be <em>so much</em> food
      there"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 noon</strong><br>Let's plan on being at my house by this
      time so we can get ready without having to rush around. &ldquo;Getting ready&rdquo;
      shouldn't take that long but that should give us more than enough time…"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 2p</strong><br>We'll leave as a group from my house and
      go to Southern Hills. It would be ideal if Brandon, Jentre, and Asher drove,
      and we all carpooled together because the other dudes will have wives who (I
      think?) will be driving themselves. The reason we're driving to Southern Hills
      is so at the end of the night your cars are there instead of the chapel. Once
      we seven get to the country club around 2:15 - 2:30, I'll arrange for someone
      to take us from the club to the chapel"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 3p</strong><br>The idea is for all of us to be at the chapel
      no later than this time. We have a room (small) to hang out in until wedding
      party pictures"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 3:30p</strong><br>Callie's and my first look outside the
      chapel"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 3:40p</strong><br>Wedding party (only) takes pictures until
      no later than 4:15"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 5p</strong><br>Ceremony begins"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 5:30p</strong><br>Pictures with families"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 6p</strong><br>Limo is taking entire wedding party to Southern
      Hills. Preference is for all bridesmaids and groomsmen to ride in the limo so
      that we all arrive together for the introduction… There are 14 total in the
      wedding party but our limo seats up to 22. So if your spouse would like to ride
      with us, that's fine! Just give us a heads up so we can account for them"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 6:30p</strong><br>Reception at Southern Hills kicks off
      with an introduction of the wedding party upon arrival. Then we'll eat, twerk,
      and have an awesome night with friends"
    - "<strong>Sunday 5/20 9:30p</strong><br>Callie's and my send-off in the limo"

Ideally, I'd love for everyone to have their tuxes picked up before the end of Friday the 18<sup>th</sup> (unless Men's Wearhouse has told you otherwise…) They should be paid for at that point, and I will reimburse you for the $20 you probably had to put down for measurements.

Southern Hills can be confusing to get around if you haven't been before or if you haven't been in a long time. [Here is a map](/uploads/SouthernHills-narrow.png) of the clubhouse from above that will hopefully help you find your way around if you're on your own. Just remember &ndash; enter from 61<sup>st</sup> street at the gate. If you're not sure where that actually is on the property, [this image](/uploads/SouthernHills-wide.png) should help. There will be a gate attendant and you can just tell him you're there for the Turner-Standridge wedding reception. Feel free to pass these images along if anyone asks you for help, too.
