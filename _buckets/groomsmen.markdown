    Heading: Schedule
    List:
    - "<strong>Friday 5/18</strong><br>Nothing scheduled for this day! I'll be sleeping
      in Broken Arrow at the Turners' so Callie and I can ride to the rehearsal at
      The Glass Chapel together"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 10a</strong><br>Rehearsal begins at The Glass Chapel.
      It's a little more than 15 minutes from midtown, in north Broken Arrow"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 11a - 2p</strong><br>Rehearsal Brunch @ 624 Kitchen in
      downtown! Brunch buffet menu can be found <a href='/uploads/menu--buffet.jpg'
      target='_blank'>here</a>. It's going to be <em>good</em>. We've elected to not
      do too many toasts or speeches because it can unintentionally drag on, SO the
      only speeches will be made by the maid-of-honor, best man, Callie & I, and my
      parents. Brunch will likely not last three hours, but we have it reserved that
      long if it does"
    - "<strong>Saturday 5/19 after 2p</strong><br>No plans! Because we're doing brunch
      and the ceremony isn't until Sunday night, we have the rest of Saturday open.
      Callie and I are grabbing dinner around 7 and we'll be out until probably 10
      but other than that, I'm not obligated to anything else"

Ideally, I'd love for everyone to have their tuxes picked up before the end of Friday the 18<sup>th</sup> (unless Men's Wearhouse has told you otherwiseâ€¦) They should be paid for at that point, and I will reimburse you for the $20 you probably had to put down for measurements.
