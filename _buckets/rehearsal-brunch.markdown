Rehearsal Brunch is scheduled to begin at 11a @ [624 Kitchen](https://goo.gl/maps/JojmvNgWkB92), however it will ultimately depend on how quickly the rehearsal wraps up at The Glass Chapel before. Some people who are attending the brunch won't be at the rehearsal, so we'll make sure everyone (or most people) are at brunch before we begin eating.

My parents will be "emceeing," but there won't be much to really direct…

They will ask everyone to grab their food and begin eating and after we've eaten for a bit, the speeches/toasts will start … probably around noon. That will go as follows (in order):  Natalie (Maid of Honor) -> Asher (Best Man) -> Callie and I -> siblings (whoever would like to) -> my parents. After my parents finish, they'll thank everyone for being there and then let everyone know they can take off whenever!
