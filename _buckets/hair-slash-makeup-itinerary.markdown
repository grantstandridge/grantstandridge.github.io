    <br> Brittany G. does Callie's hair
---

My hair lady (Brittany) will start on my hair first. Sheâ€™s bringing one of her co-workers with her. Her co-worker will curl all of the Bridesmaidsâ€™ hair (since thatâ€™s what takes up the most time), and then Brittany will style everyonesâ€™ hair after sheâ€™s done with mine. 

Natalieâ€™s sister, Sarah, will be doing all of the Bridesmaidsâ€™ makeup. Please make sure to have your foundation on already, and then Sarah will handle the rest. ðŸ˜Š
