title: Hair / Makeup Itinerary
date: 2018-04-15 19:19:00 -05:00
Schedule:
- Parent: "My hair lady (Brittany) will start on my hair first. She’s bringing one
    of her co-workers with her. Her co-worker will curl all of the Bridesmaids’ hair
    (since that’s what takes up the most time), and then Brittany will style everyones’
    hair after she’s done with mine. \n\nNatalie’s sister, Sarah, will be doing all
    of the Bridesmaids’ makeup. Please make sure to have your foundation on already,
    and then Sarah will handle the rest. \U0001F60A"
