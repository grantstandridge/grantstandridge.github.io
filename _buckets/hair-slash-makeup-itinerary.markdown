My hair lady (Brittany) will be styling everyone's hair. Sheâ€™s bringing one of her co-workers with her. Her co-worker will curl all of the Bridesmaidsâ€™ hair (since thatâ€™s what takes up the most time), and then Brittany will style everyonesâ€™ hair after it's curled. Brittany will do my hair last. 

Natalieâ€™s sister, Sarah, will be doing all of the Bridesmaidsâ€™ makeup. Please make sure to have your foundation on already, and then Sarah will handle the rest. ğŸ˜Š
